The project i worked on is Blood bank management system
The project blood bank management system is known to be a pilot project that is designed
for the blood bank to gather blood from various sources and distribute it to the needy people 
who have high requirements for it ,and this project made me learn teamspirit  
we have worked for about 3 months to build this project.
Mainly building this project brought me a lot of self satisfcation as it could save many peoples life 
and overcome problems like unavailability of blood during emergencies and can even reduce deaths due 
to lack of blood during operations, I have worked on the whole frontend part
the major problems that i have faced is alligning the tags and creating dashboard for the availability of blood representation
and make a well designed website.
