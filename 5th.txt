If i start a new company the first thing i consider in my patner is their ablity to manage things 
and to be calm in stressful situations too,
I would like to choose a person who is trustworthy and have enough kowledge in all domains
I would like to choose my friend Suraj as he has good technical knowledge and he is an amazing hard working person, 
he is a good communicator and maintains a good network of people which makes the company more stable .
and i would take haripriya, She always thinks about the problem in a unique way and always tries to give her best even at tough situations,
she always stays positive which is a very much important for the company's growth.
